# SearchEniginePredictionDataTool
This tool allows user to take keywords off a Google Spreadsheet for data collection and analysis. The tool will take the keywords and run it through Google and Bing APIs to retrieve the search predictions. Then run the predictions through AWS Comprehend API to collect the sentimental analysis. This project also includes an automated script to run daily by itself on a cloud such as EC2 to collect data over long periods of time.
